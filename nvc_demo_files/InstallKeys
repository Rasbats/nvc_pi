Hello Dave,

Thanks for the licence agreement. For the first it is enough, but I would be pleased if you can send me a manually signed agreement, when it is possible.

Attached you find the documentations for the nv.digital SDK.

Here is your manufacturer key, which is unique to your company:
  { 0x0cd9469e,0x657f194c,0x1d952eaa,0x5a9b7e38 },

The DLL will be installed by the installer of the chart CDs. Under following links you will find two sample CD with the DLL and nv.digital data for testing:

The Product ID for TEST-A is: 6ded-2104-9d5e-c6dc
The Product ID for TEST-B is: cd2a-01a3-a377-2723
(These Product IDs are not restricted. You may use them as many time as you like.)

Please let me know if you have any question.

Regards,

Ilja
